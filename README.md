This project called BinBot introduces a cutting-edge AI-based setup for automating waste segregation in order to meet the increasing demand for compact waste management in an urban setting. Now a days, cities generate more waste, and with manual segregation, this 
waste has become difficult, labor-intensive, and errorprone, which often results in improper discarding that endangers the surroundings. BinBot’s machine learning capabilities—anchored by a YOLO-based item detection model—classify waste into four 
core categories: biodegradable, recyclable, non-recyclable, and e-waste, ensuring precise and efficient sorting. 

The hardware setup of BinBot includes a compartmentalised container, divided into four sections for each type of waste. A camera has been integrated into this system, which captures the real-time pictures of each waste item as it is sent into the bin. The YOLO deep 
learning model processes these images to identify the type of waste the item belongs to, and then the item is accordingly sent to that respective bin. This self-operating system enhances the performance of waste processing, and it even reduces man-made errors that 
commonly arise in manual operations. 

In order to be in favour of sustainable urban living, tthis project BinBot influences modern image recognition technology to encourage accountable recycling and waste management.
