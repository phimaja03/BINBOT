1. Library Inclusion: Include libraries for controlling the stepper motor 
(Stepper), servo motor (Servo), and OLED display (Adafruit_SSD1306).

2. Define Constants: 
o Set the number of steps per revolution for the stepper motor. 
o Define the dimensions and reset pin for the OLED display. 

3. Object Creation:  
o Instantiate a ‘Stepper’ object for controlling the stepper motor. 
o Create a ‘Servo’ object for controlling the servo motor. 
o Instantiate an ‘Adafruit_SSD1306’ object for controlling the OLED display. 

4. Pin Definitions:  
o Define pins for the servo motor, IR sensor, and stepper motor control. 

5. Count Initilaization: 
o Initialize counters for each waste type: biodegradable, recyclable, non-recyclable, and e-waste. 
o Set flags for IR sensor readiness and object detection.

6. Detection Array: 
o Define an array to store detection signals and initialize its index to zero. 

7. Setup Function: 
o Attach the servo motor to its pin and set its initial position to 0 degrees. 
o Set the speed of the stepper motor for optimal torque. 
o Initialize serial communication for debugging and input handling. 
o Configure the IR sensor pin as input. 
o Initialize the OLED display, display a welcome message, and clear it for further use. 

Main Loop: Waste Detection and Sorting: 
1. Object detection: 
o Check if the IR sensor is ready and an object is detected (low signal from the IR sensor). 
o Store the detection signal in the array and increment the detection index. 
o Mark the object as detected and update the OLED display. 
o If any detections are stored, send a detection signal ('D') over Serial communication. 

2. Waste Type Processing: 
o If an object is detected and there is an incoming signal from a connected 

Python program: 
▪ Read the signal (‘incomingByte’) and identify the waste type 
(1 for biodegradable, 2 for recyclable, etc.).

3. Stepper Motor and Servo Actions: 
o Based on the waste type: 
▪ Biodegradable Waste (‘1’): 
➢ Move the stepper motor to the original position. 
➢ Activate the servo motor to drop the waste. 
➢ Return the stepper motor to the original position. 
▪ Recyclable Waste (‘2’): 
➢ Rotate the stepper motor half a revolution clockwise. 
➢ Activate the servo motor to drop the waste. 
➢ Return the stepper motor to the original position. 
▪ Non-Recyclable Waste (‘3’): 
➢ Rotate the stepper motor two full revolutions clockwise. 
➢ Activate the servo motor to drop the waste. 
➢ Return the stepper motor to the original position. 
▪ E-Waste (‘4’): 
➢ Rotate the stepper motor half a revolution 
counterclockwise. 
➢ Activate the servo motor to drop the waste. 
➢ Return the stepper motor to the original position. 

4. Post- Processing: 
o Reset the servo motor to 0 degrees. 
o Reset flags (‘irSensorReady’, ‘objectDetected’) for new detections. 
o Clear the detection array to prepare for new waste detection. 

Display Update Function: 
1.Clear the OLED display to prepare for a new message. 
2.Print the counts for each waste type: 
• First row: Biodegradable and Recyclable waste counts. 
• Second row: Non-recyclable and E-Waste counts. 
3.Update the display to show the new counts. 

Detection Array Reset Function: 
1.Iterate through the detection array and reset each element to a default value (e.g., ' '). 
2.Reset the detection index to zero.
